Makes use of osu!'s "date added" feature by changing the .osu files' creation dates to the date they were ranked/last updated.


# Requirements

* A windows platform (Windows 7+) with the [latest version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This won't work on Linux.

# Installing
* Clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/fastpacedsociety/osu-dates.git`)
* Installing python packages that the script uses (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

# Usage

```
python osu!dates.py
``` 
or run it directly by opening the .py file. If you ever want to revert back to your old dates, run restore.py
